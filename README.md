Project Overview:

Developed a dynamic data structure in Java to manage runner statistics for the upcoming Olympics. Utilized 2-3 trees for efficient querying and implemented custom classes for streamlined data management.

Key Elements:

Data Structures: Employed 2-3 trees for organizing and querying minimum and average run times. Custom classes encapsulated runner data and race operations.

Algorithms: Implemented logarithmic complexity for insertion and deletion. Calculated statistics like minimum and average run times swiftly leveraging 2-3 tree properties.

Implementation Details:

Initialization: Designed Race class for initializing the data structure.

Data Management: Added methods for adding runners, recording run times, and removing data efficiently.

Statistics: Computed minimum and average run times with optimized algorithms.

Lessons Learned:

Efficient Data Management: Acquired insights into managing large datasets using balanced trees.

Algorithm Optimization: Enhanced skills in optimizing algorithms for improved time complexity.

Java Proficiency: Strengthened proficiency in Java, especially in implementing custom data structures.
